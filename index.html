        <p>Intended for experienced or tech-savvy working adults and self-motivated learners; students will meet twice a week for 12 weeks in a high paced independent learning environment.
       </p>

       <h2>Summary</h2>
       <p>Once you have conquered front-end development you will learn how to build a web backend using NodeJS. You will build your own data API that connects to a MongoDB database. You will build a JavaScript client and traditional web front-end to display and interact with your data. You will apply you newly acquired backend knowledge to build your own cloud based server via Amazon Web Services (AWS).
       </p>
       <p>You will wrap class by learning Angular and Ionic. This powerful, front-end technology allows you to build cross platform applications using web technology. You will build client applications that can be compiled into Progrssive Web (PWA) and Hybrid Mobile Applications.
       </p>
       <p>Additionally, we will discuss security best practices and mobile first design concepts as well as extreme programming, agile and scrum methodologies. You will apply these skills throughout the course building an array of applications to add to your project portfolio.
